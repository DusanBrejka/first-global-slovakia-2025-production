## Countdown
The Arena Countdown is a custom-made transparent WebM (VP9+Opus) video with a timer and event logos. It is used as an overlay along with SPX template on the main output and also displayed on the TV in the arena.

It was originally created as an HTML5 page by [Martin ƒåamaj](https://camajko.sk) available on [Screentimer.Camajko.sk](https://www.screentimer.camajko.sk).
This was then recorded in OBS (with custom CSS to enable background transparency) into 3 renditions - with black, green and transparent background.

It is designed to be used with vMix 4K and can be controlled via the Elgato Stream Deck Mini. The countdown can be configured, reset, started, and stopped using the buttons on the Stream Deck Mini.

[<img src="https://github.com/DusanBrejka/first-global-slovakia-2025-production/blob/master/docs/countdown_black.png?raw=true" width="30%" />](docs/countdown_black.png) 
[<img src="https://github.com/DusanBrejka/first-global-slovakia-2025-production/blob/master/docs/countdown_green.png?raw=true" width="30%" />](docs/countdown_green.png)

Alternative version with green background to key out was created in case vMix didn't properly support transparent WebMs, but was not used during the show as no transparency or keying was needed.

### Countdown Automation
The countdown automation is controlled via the Elgato Stream Deck Mini, which has buttons for:
- **Arena Timer TV Toggle**: Sets the Arena TV (Mix 4) to the countdown video or Sponsors presentation loop
- **Timer RESET**: Resets the countdown 2:30 and stops the timer
- **Timer START**: Starts or pauses the countdown timer
- **Logo Overlay**: Toggles the static logo overlay on and off (Ovl 2)
- **SPX Overlay**: Toggles the SPX fullscreen overlays on and off (Ovl 3)
- **Timer Overlay**: Toggles the countdown cropped virtual input overlay on and off (Ovl 4)

## üéµ Music Playlist Used During the Event

All music used during the event was sourced from the [YouTube Audio Library](https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary), which provides free music for creators. Our selection was driven by the need for dynamic, non-distracting background tracks that would suit a wide variety of scenes. We prioritized tracks that had a cinematic or rhythmic quality, modern production, and would keep the energy consistent across the stream.

Below is a list of all tracks used:

## vMix 4 M/E testing preset
[Colours_test.vmix](vmix-4me/colours_test.vmix)

This is a 4 M/E boilerplate - preset for vMix 4K useful for testing complex routing options. It includes 16 inputs mixable into 4 Mix outputs with fade transition and current time as static overlay on Mix 4. PGM is routable to other Mixes.
![vMix_colours_test.png](vmix-4me/vMix_colours_test.png)

You should ideally use this preset along with Bitfocus Companion configuration file for the Elgato Stream Deck XL mentioned below.

## Bitfocus Companion configuration
[vmix_4me_sdxl.companionconfig](vmix-4me/vmix_4me_sdxl.companionconfig) - compatible with Elgato Stream Deck XL

![streamdeck_xl_photo.jpg](vmix-4me/streamdeck_xl_photo.jpg)

This is a Bitfocus Companion configuration file for the Elgato Stream Deck XL, which includes buttons for controlling vMix 4K 4 M/E setup.
It allows you to control the Preview (PVW), Program (PGM), Full screen 1-2 output, Mixes 2-4 (Mix 1 = PGM), Overlays, and media players directly from the Stream Deck XL along with other controllers.

Preview (PVW) input buttons are cutting (sending) the input to the Preview bus on Mix 1, while the Program (PGM) input buttons are cutting the input to the PGM bus without changing the preview. This behaviour is more common for matrix switchers such as Winwet Hy-1650HD used in conjunction with other master switchers, where the Preview bus is used to prepare the next input before cutting it to the Program output.

The Mix buttons allow you to control the Mixes 2-4 which are typically set as outputs 2-4 in vMix.

In Bitfocus Companion, the Input buttons on Mix 2-4 are set to send the Input to the Preview of that Mix and straight after transition it to the Program output of that Mix via Fade transition with a duration of 300ms by default. This duration is configured as a $(custom:mix_transition_duration) variable in the configuration file, which can be adjusted to your needs globally.

## Winwet Hy-1650HD configuration
[winwet_hy-1650hd_vmix_config.config](vmix-4me/winwet_hy-1650hd_vmix_config.config) - vMix Shortcuts & Activators

>‚ùóWarning: Backup your current vMix configuration before importing this file‚ùó

Importing this configuration will overwrite your existing vMix Shortcuts and Activators and reset all the other settings to vMix defaults. I suggest importing it manually by modifying your current XML configuration to ensure you don't lose any other settings you may have.

## üôå Why This Exists

All of the documentation, diagrams, and configurations in this repository are shared openly to support students, educators, and aspiring AV professionals who are curious about **real-world live video production at scale**. By publishing the full technical setup behind FIRST Global Slovakia 2025, my goal is to **demystify complex AV workflows** and encourage more young people to explore the fields of **video engineering, broadcast infrastructure, and live event production**.

Whether you're setting up a school livestream, running a robotics competition, or just love the intersection of **STEM, media, and creativity** ‚Äî I hope this serves as a helpful starting point and inspiration.
